          Happy Rose Day! 🌷 Just wanted to drop a virtual rose your way since we cannot meet. I'm grateful for the smiles and fun moments we've shared ❤️. Most of the fun moments were online but still it was great ✨.
I expect that you will give me a rose 🌹 when we meet the next time since you are not giving a virtual one now (I'm kidding 😂).

            I see no point of writing my name here since you already know it 😂 </span
